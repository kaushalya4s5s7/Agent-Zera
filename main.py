ðŸ”’ ZERA - Advanced Smart Contract Security Auditing System
An intelligent multi-agent system specialized in Solidity security analysis

Agents:
- ZeraSecurityAuditor: Identifies vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- GasOptimizer: Finds gas efficiency improvements  
- AuditReporter: Generates comprehensive audit reports

Capabilities:
- Comprehensive security vulnerability detection
- Gas optimization analysis
- Professional audit report generation
- Multi-agent collaborative analysis
